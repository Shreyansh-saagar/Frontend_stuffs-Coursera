                    </div>
                    <p>It is a syrupy dessert popular in the Indian subcontinent and regions with South Asian diaspora. It is made from ball-shaped dumplings of chhena (an Indian cottage cheese) and semolina dough, cooked in light sugar syrup made of sugar. This is done until the syrup permeates the dumplings.The earliest evidence of rasagola can be found in the epic poem Dandi Ramayana.
                    The spongy rasgulla is believed to have been introduced in present West Bengal.
